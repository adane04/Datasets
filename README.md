This dataset comprises physical examination records from a local medical center, containing 110,300 entries from approximately 80,000 anonymous patients. For each physical examination record, 62 feature items are chosen from a pool of over 100 examination items, utilizing the expertise of medical professionals and relevant literature. These selected feature items encompass four fundamental physical examination components, 26 blood routine elements, 12 urine routine parameters, and 20 indicators related to liver function.
